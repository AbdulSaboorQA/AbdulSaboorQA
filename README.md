# üëã Hi, I‚Äôm Abdul Saboor, an ISTQB Certified QA Engineer on a Mission to Break Things (So You Don‚Äôt)

With 5+ years of manual testing experience and 2+ years in automation, I‚Äôve worked on 13+ products used by more than 25 million people worldwide. From apps to complex APIs and multi-platform releases, I bring a structured, thoughtful approach to ensuring quality.

I help teams catch critical issues before users do by designing smart test plans, writing meaningful test cases, automating where it counts, and collaborating closely with developers. To me, QA isn‚Äôt just about finding bugs it‚Äôs about improving the product, supporting the team, and delivering smooth, confident releases.

## ‚ö° Fun Fact

When I‚Äôm not testing software, I‚Äôm probably at the gym, watching a new series, or trying to convince my cat to let me work in peace. I also love playing badminton and table tennis, anything with speed and precision!
